# Interpreting Image as Graphs and using Breadth First Search to compute the shortest distance between pixels 

Here we compute the shortest path between two pixels using three different distance measures, namely 4-adjacency, 8-adjacency, and m-adjacency measures. 

The pixels are first mapped into undirected graphs where each pixels is a graph node and the connections are formed based on the type of adjacency measure selected. 

Thereafter, the shortest path between two pixels is found using Breadth First search algorithms. Other algorithms that can also be used for finding the shortest path are Djikstra's, A*, etc.
